        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dog birthday cake is super fun to make. I made this for my dog, and she ate it all up. The honey is optional, but it makes the cake a sweeter treat for the dog. And yes, I tried some â€” it's pretty good.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/3 cup honey (optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded carrots</li>
            <li>1 cup whole water or white floor</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 6-cup ring mold or fluted tube pan.</li>
            <li>Combine egg, honey, peanut butter, oil, and vanilla in a large bowl; blend well. Stir in carrots until well-combined. Sift together flour and baking soda and fold into carrot mixture. Spoon cake batter into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
